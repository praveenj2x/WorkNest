# GhostNet – AI-Powered HR Workflow Automation  

(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ Built during the **Kiro Hackathon** using **Kiro IDE**, **Kiro Hooks**, and **MCP**  

WorkNest automates repetitive HR operations — onboarding, check-ins, and performance summaries — by connecting HR systems, AI, and workplace tools into one unified workflow.  

---

## Overview ( •_•)>⌐■-■  

WorkNest is an **AI-driven HR assistant** that streamlines day-to-day human resource tasks.  
It integrates with **Slack**, **Google Workspace**, and internal systems to handle:  

- Automated onboarding  
- Employee surveys and forms  
- Performance report generation  
- Attendance tracking  
- Real-time status updates  

This project embodies the **Frankenstein** category — stitching together AI, automation, and workplace integrations into a single intelligent HR core using Kiro’s local environment.

## Tech Stack (•̀ᴗ•́)و  

- **Kiro IDE** – development and runtime environment  
- **Kiro Hooks** – event-driven automation  
- **MCP (Multi-Context Processing)** – context-aware task execution  
- **Slack API** – team communication integration  
- **Google Workspace API** – data management and form syncing  
- **AI Modules** – for text understanding, summarization, and reporting  

---

## Architecture (⌐▨_▨)  

WorkNest is designed as a modular HR automation system built on top of the **Kiro local agent**.  

**Flow Summary:**  
1. **Trigger:** A Kiro Hook detects an HR-related event (e.g., a new hire form submission).  
2. **Processing:** MCP handles context aggregation and invokes AI modules.  
3. **Integration:** Outputs are sent to Slack, Google Sheets, or internal dashboards.  
4. **Automation:** Workflow loops execute on schedule or trigger basis.  

**Example:**  
- HR fills out a Google Form → Kiro Hook triggers → AI summarizes onboarding → Slack message auto-sent to HR channel.
